    // for each one and put them in the list.

ATTRIBUTES:
- Every member variable should be private. 

CONSTRUCTORS:
- The constructor of a class must have the same name as the class name in which it resides.
- A class can have any number of constructors.
- A constructor can not be abstract, final, and Synchronized.
- A constructor doesnâ€™t have any return type.

METHODS:
- Getters and Setters should be used to access the data.
- Getters should not have any parameters and should not prompt the user for anything, but instead, simply return a value.
- Setters should accept a single parameter and have a void return type.
