Activity Instructions
Practice the principle of inheritance by creating a base class and derived classes.

For this activity, you will write classes to represent different kinds of homework 
assignments. Consider the following example of Math and writing assignments.

Math Assignments
A Math assignment may need to store the student's name, the topic (for example,
 "Fractions"), the textbook section (for example, "7.3"), and the problems from 
 that section (for example, "3-10, 20-21").

The Math assignment should have a constructor that requires a value for each of 
the items that it stores.

The Math assignment needs to provide a method to return a summary of the assignment 
that contains the student's name and the topic, and it also needs to provide a method 
to display the Math homework list including the section number and the problems (for 
example, "Section 7.3 Problems 8-19").

Writing Assignments
A writing assignment may need to store the student's name, the topic (for example, 
"European History"), and the title of the assignment (for example, "The Causes of 
World War II").

The writing assignment should have a constructor that requires a value for each of 
the items that it stores.

The writing assignment needs to provide a method to return a summary of the assignment 
that contains the student's name and the topic, and it also needs to provide a method 
to get the writing information which consists of the title and the student's name 
(for example, "The Causes of World War II by Mary Waters").

Design the Classes
There are a number of things these classes have in common and a number of differences. 
Using inheritance, you can separate the things that change from the things that stay 
the same, putting the common elements in a base class and the differing elements in a 
derived class.

Consider the following class diagram:

Class Diagram showing separate classes
Class Diagram Without Inheritance
From these diagrams you can see that the _studentName and _topic attributes are the same 
in both classes, and so is the GetSummary() method. Instead of duplicating these items, 
you can create a base class that they both inherit from.

The following class diagram shows an approach that uses inheritance. This is the approach 
you will use for this assignment.


Class Diagram Showing Inheritance
Start the Project
Open the class project in VS Code.
Navigate to the Learning04 project in the prepare directory. Find the Program.cs file, 
which will be your entry point for the program.
Verify that you can run the project.
Create the base class
Begin by creating a new file and a class for your base Assignment class.
Add the attributes as private member variables.
Create a constructor for this class that receives a student name and topic and sets the 
member variables.
Add the method for GetSummary() to return the student's name and the topic.
Test your class by returning to the Main method in the Program.cs file. Create a simple 
assignment, call the method to get the summary, and then display it to the screen.

Sample Output


Samuel Bennett - Multiplication
Create the MathAssignment class
Create a new file for the MathAssignment class.
Create this class and make sure to specify that it inherits from the base Assignment class.
Add the attributes as private member variables. Make sure that you do not create new member 
variables for the ones you inherited from the base class.
Create a constructor for your class that accepts all four parameters, have it call the base 
class constructor to set the base class attributes that way.
Add the GetHomeworkList() method.
Test your class by returning to the Main method and creating a new MathAssignment object and 
set its values. Make sure to test both the GetSummary() and the GetHomeworkList() methods.
Sample Output


Roberto Rodriguez - Fractions
Section 7.3 Problems 8-19
Create the WritingAssignment class
Follow the same pattern as before by creating a new file for the WritingAssignment class.
Create the class and set up the inheritance relationship.
Add the member variables and set up the constructor as you did for the MathAssignment class.
Add the GetWritingInformation() method.
Notice that this method needs to access the _studentName variable defined in the base class. 
Even though WritingAssignment class inherited this attribute, it is private, so you cannot 
access it directly in the derived class.
To get the data you need for the method you can either make the variable protected in the 
base class, or you can create a public GetStudentName method to return it.
Return to Main and test your new class.
Sample Output


Mary Waters - European History
The Causes of World War II by Mary Waters
