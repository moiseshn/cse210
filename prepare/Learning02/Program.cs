1. Design the Classes
You program should contain two classes one for a Job and one for the 
    Resume itself, as follows:

Class: Job
Responsibilities:
Keeps track of the company, job title, start year, and end year.
Behaviors:
Displays the job information in the format "Job Title (Company) 
    StartYear-EndYear", for example: "Software Engineer (Microsoft) 
    2019-2022".

Class: Resume
Responsibilities:
Keeps track of the person's name and a list of their jobs.
Behaviors:
Displays the resume, which shows the name first, followed by displaying 
    each one of the jobs.


2. Start the Project
    - Open the class project in VS Code.
    - Navigate to the Learning02 project in the prepare folder. Find 
    the Program.cs file, which will be your entry point for the program.
    - Verify that you can run the project and see the beginning "Hello 
    World" output.

3. Create the Job class
    - Create a new file for your job class. By convention this should 
    be named Job.cs .
    - Create the class (Hint this is the public class Job syntax).
    - Create member variables in the class for each element that this 
    class should contain. By convention these member variables should 
    begin with an underscore and a lowercase letter such as _jobTitle .

4. Test your Job class
    - Back in your Program.cs file, add code to your Main function.
    - Create a new job instance named job1 .
    - Set the member variables using the dot notation (for example, 
    job1._jobTitle = "Software Engineer";
    - Verify that you can display the company of this job on the screen, 
    again using the dot notation to access the member variable.
    - Create a second job, set its variables, display this company on 
    the screen as well.

5. Add a Display method to the Job class
    - Return to your Job.cs file and add a method (member function) to 
    display the job details. This method should not have any parameters 
    and does not need to return anything. By convention, this method 
    should begin with a capital letter, such as Display, and if you 
    have multiple words each word should be capitalized, such as 
    DisplayJobDetails .
    - This method should display the job details on the screen in the 
    correct format. Remember that the method can access the member 
    variables directly, without needing them to be passed into it.
    - Return to your Program.cs file. Remove the lines of code where 
    you displayed the company earlier, and replace them with calls to 
    your new method. Remember that you call the method using the same 
    dot notation such as job1.Display(); .
        Sample Output
        Software Engineer (Microsoft) 2019-2022
        Manager (Apple) 2022-2023

6. Create the Resume class
    - Create a new file for your Resume class. Each class should be in 
    its own file and the file name should match the name of the class.
    - Create the Resume class.
    - Create the member variable for the person's name.
    - Create the member variable for the list of Jobs. (Hint: the data 
    type for this should be List<Job> , and it is probably easiest to 
    initialize this to a new list right when you declare it..)

7. Test your Resume class
    - Return to your Program.cs. Add the end of the Main function, 
    create a new instance of the Resume class.
    - Add the two jobs you created earlier, to the list of jobs in the 
    resume object.
    - Verify that you can access and display the first job title using 
    dot notation similar to myResume._jobs[0]._jobTitle .

8. Add a Display method to the Resume class
    - Return to your Resume class and add a method to display its 
    details.
    - This method should not have any parameters and should not return 
    anything.
    - In the method body, you should display the person's name and then 
    iterate through each Job instance in the list of jobs and display 
    them.
    - Hint: remember that you can call each job's Display method that 
    you created earlier.
    - Return to your main function, remove any code that is displaying 
    information, and instead, add a call at the end to the Display 
    method from your Resume class to display the name and all the jobs 
    in one line.
